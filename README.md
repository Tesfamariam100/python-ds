# Python Data Structures and Notebooks

Complete the tasks in the Python Notebook in this repository.
To be submitted for credit, all changes must be committed and pushed to this repository (do not create your own repository unless instructed to on the course website).
***
### Objectives
This project focuses on reinforcing key Python concepts such as data structures, functions, and more. 

### Assignment Overview
**1. Clone the Starter Repository**
Copy the base repository to your GitHub account using the "Use this Template" button. The starter repository is available here.
Clone the repository to your local machine using Git or Git Bash.
**2. Complete Notebook Tasks**
Open the cloned Jupyter Notebook locally. You can use JupyterLab, Jupyter Notebook, or VS Code.
Complete the tasks by editing the Python code cells and Markdown cells.
For each task:
* Write your solution.
* Run the notebook cells.
* Commit and push your changes to GitHub.
* Verify that the changes are reflected in your GitHub repository.
**Required:** In your introduction, include a clickable link to your GitHub repo and use clear Markdown headings to organize your solutions by question number.

**3. Export to HTML**
After completing all tasks, export your notebook to an HTML file. This makes the notebook accessible as a web page, enabling easy sharing. You can export using one of the following methods:

* Jupyter Menu:
Go to File -> Save and Export As -> HTML to export your notebook.

* Inline Command:
Add a Python cell at the end of your notebook and run the following:

* python
Copy code
!jupyter nbconvert --to html python-ds.ipynb
os Package:
Use the os package to run the export command:

*python
Copy code
import os
os.system('jupyter nbconvert --to html python-ds.ipynb')
Terminal Command:
In your terminal, run the following command:

* bash
Copy code
jupyter nbconvert --to html python-ds.ipynb
**4. Review and Finalize**
Review the exported HTML pages to get a sense of how your notebook looks when converted to a web page.
Add a README.md to your repository with details about your project and how you exported the notebook.
Example Command for Git:

* bash
Copy code
git add python-ds.html
git commit -m "Added exported HTML file"
git push origin main
GitHub Repository
python-ds.ipynb
python-ds.html
How to Use
**Clone the repository:**
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/python-ds.git
Open the Jupyter Notebooks or view the HTML files to see the project solutions.
## Rubric

**Each question is worth one point.**
